Find (in Files) -- a ROX Utility

Changelog:
-----------------
Version 003 (26-05-2005)
	* Big rewrite, more or less
	* Use gtk.ComboBoxEntry where available instead of gtk.Entry
	* New class EntryThing (nice name) to wrap the above and add history support
	* Each entry box has history of up to 10 items
	* Fixed bugs: 
		- failed to parse text containing ':' properly
		- button sensitivity handling was not quite right
		- probably more that I don't remember :)

Version 002 (23-05-2005)
	* Set appropriate toolbar button sensitivity
	* Protect ellipsize and FileChooserDialog code from older (py)gtk versions.
	* Add drop target support - drag folder to icon to launch and search from that path
		(Suggested by Musus Umbra)
